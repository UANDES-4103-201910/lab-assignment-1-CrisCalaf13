Q3) Basically there are two principal structures in the HTML code. The first one is the "Head" and the second one is the "body".
    The "head "section seems to be the code for the main title of the webpage. In other side, the "body" is wher it goes all the 
    relevant content of the wbebsite. 
	
    There are some HTML tags or functions to explain.

    class: Describe the type of the section. e.g: class = "athing"
    id: the identification
    href: an hyperlink or reference.
    style: The characteristics of the class.

    and others...

Q4) (index): like the name says, is the indexation of the components. In othe words is the distribution of the elements in the webpage.
     hn.js?ok3V8Gydw5sSOFppv3U2: Description of the functions of the page
     news.css?ok3V8Gydw5sSOFppv3U2: Description of the "style" of the components of the webpage; like size of images, color, font and other things.

Q5) Searching in google for XHR request, it says the following:
     "XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is an API available to web browser 
     scripting languages such as JavaScript. It is used to 
     send HTTP or HTTPS requests to a web server and load the 
     server response data back into the script". 
	
     So, this file must by loaded by the web browser everytime 
     that an user "commit" a change in the page, like click in a 
     link or upvoting a "like" in the forum. 

Q6) After emitting the security certificate, the browser showed 
    me a window with security information.
    The certificate was emmited by: COMODO RSA Domain 
                                    Validation Secure Server
    And it's valid from 21-08-2014 to 21-08-2019.
